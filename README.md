# WrestlingSimulator

This is a project I made over winter break, a simulator for High School/College Wrestling! This was inspired a project my older brother made his senior year of high school using excel.

Other major sports, baseball, basketball, football, have major video games (2K, Madden, etc) that enable users to simulate games and tournaments, but Collegiate Wrestling lacks any such platform

This simulator is in its early stages. In its current state, it allows the user to launch a bracket simulation of 8 randomly generated teams/schools,
a double-elimination tournament of 16 randomly generated wrestlers, or a tournament between 16 randomly generated teams (with each of the 10 weight classes having
their own individual tournament).

Each tournament/mode allows for the user to look at the play-by-play of each and every match wrestled, the ratings of each player, each weight class' bracket, team scores, or (in duel mode) the duel box score.

Moving forward, I am looking to make the output both more easily readable with colored text, make the UI more accessible, and develop further game modes.

These game modes include:


Season: Similar to NFL Madden's Franchise mode, operate as the coach of a team. Choose to set your lineup each week, play various games (tbd) to make your team better, etc.
    
Real Life Simulation: Want to preview this years NCAA championship? Select from a variety of the most prolific wrestling programs in the country and simulate the tournament!
    
Fantasy Draft: What if Spencer Lee signed with Penn State instead? Conduct a fantasy draft with other top programs and simulate a new season.
    
Redshirt: You're an up and coming wrestler trying to achieve ultimate glory in the NCAA championship. Through mini-games, develop your wrestler over 4 years of collegiate elligibility, fight for a starting spot, 
and earn the crown!
